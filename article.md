# clean_architecture

Understanding a project's architecture is a fundamental aspect of software development.

Clean architecture is a way of designing software that makes code more understandable and flexible. It breaks the application into independent parts, each of which performs its own specific task, and at the same time they are weakly dependent on each other. This makes it easier to change and expand the application without affecting other parts of the application. The point is to make the code cleaner and more organized, making it easier to maintain and develop.
